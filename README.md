# new github repo
creating a local repo and then pushing it to github

# new change
just rechecking again

# updated the default origin
why write git push origin main everytime?
use : git push -u origin main once and
use : git push ever after

# jst got to know
we can add and commit in the same command if no new files are being added that is by using
git push -am "message to commit"
